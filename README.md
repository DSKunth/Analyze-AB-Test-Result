# Analyze A/B Test Results
An e-commerce company has developed a new web page in order to test and increase the number of users who ***"convert"***, meaning the number of users who decide to pay for their products and services. The goal of this project is to help the company decide whether they should ***implement the new web page***, ***keep the old page*** or ***run the experiment longer*** to make their decision.

## Project Tasks
1. Probability
2. A/B Test - interpret the test statistic and p-value
3. Regression - analyze interaction effects on all of p-value and statistical significance to predict conversions
4. Conclusion - include both statistical reasoning and practical reasoning for the situation
